        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Richard Święch. <span>I started learning piano when I was six</span>, in a private musich school.
            I continued
            my education with great teachers and piano players such as Piotr Kalicki, Adam Niedzielin, and also at
            Krakowska Szkoła Jazzu i Muzyki Rozrywkowej. Since the day when I started playing, <span>I’ve gained 25
                years of
                experience in playing piano</span> on many fields, such as solo piano, piano and keyboards in a band,
            music
            theory, composition and music production.</p>
        <p>At the moment I've got also <span>15 years of experience in teaching piano</span>. I started sharing my
            knowledge when I
            was 18. In 2012 I launched <span>my own private music school</span> - Smileflow ArtCompany - which is now
            one of the
            biggest companies here in Cracow, offering private piano, violin and vocal classes.</p>
        <p>As a piano teacher I worked with all kinds of people - employees of high-tech companies such as <span>Google
                and
                Cisco (including lessons in headquaters of this companies in Cracow)</span>, and people who graduated
            only from
            high school. Architects, lecturers, nurses, gardeners, whole families, children from age 4-5 through
            students and adults up to age 60+ (my oldest student was 72 when he started his lessons), people who had 10
            or more years of experience, and those who dreamt about playing piano and just wanted to start without
            knowing anything.</p>
