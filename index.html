        <h2>about me</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p><span class="indent">My</span> name is Richard Święch. <span class="bold">I started learning piano when
                    I
                    was six</span>,
                in a private
                musich school.
                I continued
                my education with great teachers and piano players such as Piotr Kalicki, Adam Niedzielin, and also at
                Krakowska Szkoła Jazzu i Muzyki Rozrywkowej. Since the day when I started playing, <span class="bold">I’ve
                    gained 25
                    years of
                    experience in playing piano</span> on many fields, such as solo piano, piano and keyboards in a
                band,
                music
                theory, composition and music production.</p>
            <p><span class="indent">At</span> the moment I've got also <span class="bold">15 years of experience in
                    teaching piano</span>.
                I started
                sharing my
                knowledge when I
                was 18. In 2012 I launched <span class="bold">my own private music school</span> - Smileflow ArtCompany
                -
                which is now
                one of the
                biggest companies here in Cracow, offering private piano, violin and vocal classes.</p>
            <p><span class="indent">As</span> a piano teacher I worked with all kinds of people - employees of
                high-tech
                companies such as
                <span class="bold">Google
                    and
                    Cisco (including lessons in headquaters of this companies in Cracow)</span>, and people who
                graduated
                only from
                high school. Architects, lecturers, nurses, gardeners, whole families, children from age 4-5 through
                students and adults up to age 60+ (my oldest student was 72 when he started his lessons), people who
                had 10
                or more years of experience, and those who dreamt about playing piano and just wanted to start without
                knowing anything.</p>
